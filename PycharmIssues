Q ) Created a django project dj_pj, outside PycharmProjects folder created by pycharm IDE. On opening pycharm IDE and opening the project inside it to work, 
    Pycharm is unable to refer to the imported django libraries. Pychrm shows erroe like "Error resolving names...". "Mark Directory as -> Sources Root" didn't help. 
    How to resolve it ?
A ) Its resolved if I create my django project inside the PycharmProjects folder. Then Pycharm is able to resolve all the library references.
